        <h1>An Introduction to Using PHPass</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my tutorial. I made this tutorial as a student for a web development course. how to make a really strong password login system to protect against hackers.
            In the process, I learned a lot about hashing and web security in general. 
            I was also surprised to see how few web developer tutorials are up to date on security issues. There were a lot 
            of tutorials for log-in systems that mentioned using md5's and sha1! </p>
        <p>As a result, I am writing a tutorial on PHPass, (pronounced "ph-pass"). If you are using php 5.5 or newer, this may not be the most up 
            to date method. However, as not everyone has 5.5 installed just yet, PHPass is still a great way to secure passwords.
            Hashing is the very first thing every aspiring web developer should know to not only protect your 
            client, but also yourself from harm. </p>
        <p>Now, as I was doing research on PHPass, I also discovered there was a dearth of good tutorials on creating 
            a basic login and user accounts for a webpage connected to a database. So in this tutorial I will show you not 
            just how to use PHPass, but also how to use it in the context of creating a basic login and create user account 
            pages for a website. In a later tutorial, I would like to show how to login using the accounts that have already
            been created.</p>
        <p>First a little bit about password security to begin with. Let's start with this cartoon from <a href="http://xkcd.com/936/">xkcd</a>:</p>
        <A HREF="http://xkcd.com/936/"><IMG SRC="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png" alt="xkcd comic"></a>
        <p> Just recently, the popular web data encryption system OpenSSL has found a flaw called the 
            Heartbleed bug. In order to protect themselves, millions of users all over the world are 
            having to change their passwords to avoid being hacked. </p>
   <h2>What are some common ways to 
        strengthen your password?</h2>
        <ul>
             
            <li>Length of password. You don't want to make a password that is too short. I would 
                recommend at least 10 character passwords. As you will see in this tutorial, a password
                that is too long is also putting a server at risk of Denial-of-Service attacks. For this 
                reason, I put in code to keep a user from entering a password that is greater than 72
                characters. Besides, who can remember 72 characters anyway?</li>
            <li>Make it unique. Remember there are databases of passwords that have already been hacked.
                They are called "rainbow tables." So don't use something just anyone can come up with 
                like "123letsgo" or "password" or "abcletters." Just saying...And while I'm at it, 
                don't use common names, cities, birthdays, or other important dates. 
               </li>
            <li>Try creating a sentence for a password. This makes it both easy to remember and unique.</li>
            <li>I'm not completely convinced on the logic of using uppercase, lowercase, digits and 
                special characters all together. As the comic shows above, you probably won't remember it
                easily, and it could still be vulnerable to attacks. Better to just make it a unique 
                string that you can remember and the hackers can't guess.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            For a really good video on password security with the php language, go
            <a href="http://youtu.be/eNdW5HWBhG0">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p> In order to beat your enemy, you need to know their strategies. Here is a list of basic ways 
            that hackers can gain access to your password. Fortunately, PHPass combats many of these 
            strategies.</p>
         <h2>Common password attacks</h2>
        <ul>
           
            <li>Dictionary attack. If it is a real word that can be found in a dictionary, it can 
                probably be hacked.If you are going to use words, use multiple unrelated words.</li>
            <li>Brute force attack. Dictionary attack plus possible alphanumeric combinations. 
                This is a very common form of attack. Hashing with a strong framework such as PHPass
                protects against brute force.</li>
            <li>Rainbow table attack. Rainbow tables are a list of hashes that  have already been cracked.
            It takes time to sort through the rainbow table to find these hashes, so you want to reduce 
            the time available for look-up. These attacks are not as common these days, but PHPass still protects against them.</li>
            <li>Malware. I have been a victim of this myself. Often, I am looking up something I need to 
                download. Instead of going to the official site, an official-looking site claims to have 
                the document I need. Then I download it, not realizing I am also downloading malware into 
                my computer, which introduces all sorts of problems from flashing advertisements to 
                screenshots of the login process or recording everything you type. </li>
            <li>Phishing. This is where an e-mail that looks legit is sent to you asking you for 
                identifying information such as name and password. This will then be used to seriously 
                mess up your life. Don't fall for it, because legitimate companies such as banks or other
                companies that require login will never ask you to send your password via email.</li>
             </ul>
            <p>There are many other ways that people can try to gain access to your password. The best
                thing you can do is to start off with a strong password, using the tips I just mentioned.
                Also, as a web developer, I can't emphasize enough how important it is to keep up to date
                on current hashing techniques and employ them with every database you use. To not do so 
                could put you, your company or your clients at risk.</p>
       
        <p>Now that I have discussed password security at length, here is a little bit about PHPass and how it
            works. PHPass is a portable hashing framework for use in php password entry applications.
            Although it can work with PHP 3 and above, it is recommended to have at least PHP 5.3.0 and 
            above. If you have PHP 5.5 or later versions, you may find other, 
            stronger password security libraries. To use it, you have to download the source file <a href="http://www.openwall.com/phpass/">here</a>and link 
            to it whenever you have a user enter a password into a database.</p>
        <p>PHPass works by using a three-pronged approach to making password entry tough to crack.  
            PHPass uses a strong combination of salting, key stretching, and Bcrypt. Salts are either
            added to the beginning or end of your hash, making them harder to crack, because they are 
            truly random.Salting prevents rainbow table attacks. 
        Key stretching is the processing of doing multiple iterations before producing output. Time is 
        of the essence for hackers and this slows them down considerably.
        Bcrypt is meant as a way to prevent brute force hacking, which I previously discussed as being 
        one of the more common methods of attack. It uses key stretching by setting the amount of 
        iterations to be done per hash.
        </p>
        <h1>What you need to begin with:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Access to a mySQL database with phpMyAdmin.</li>
            <li>Basic understanding of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and PHP.</li>
            <li>PHP 5.3 +</li>
        </ul>
        <p> You will also need to set up the following files:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>PasswordHash.php (see below)</li>
            <li>index.php</li>
            <li>create_user.php</li>
            <li>create_user_style.css</li>
            
   
        </ul>
        <p> Go <a href="http://www.openwall.com/phpass/">here</a> to download PHPass.
            When you download it, you will create a separate file for the PHPass code called "PasswordHash.php"</p>
        <h1>Setting up the database table.</h1>
        <p>Here is the basic database table I set up in phpMyadmin. Id is your primary field, and it is 
            auto-incremented. For a standard website that someone wants to join as a user, you will want
            a username, password, and e-mail. Other tutorials will have you include salt as a field in the database, 
            however PHPass already takes care of that for you. For those who are wondering, salt is an extra protection 
            against brute force hackers.</p><br>
        <p>If you are unfamiliar with setting up tables on a database using phpMyadmin, check out the 
            following video tutorials on New Boston:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://youtu.be/msCY6evKpNI">phpMyAdmin Part 1</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://youtu.be/Yo5y49DHslw">phpMyAdmin Part 2</a></li>

        <h1>Creating the user account creation page.</h1>
        <p>
            This is where we provide the user with a form for creating new accounts.
            Most websites include a captcha or email verification, or both. This could 
            be a topic for a future tutorial. 
        </p>
        <p>The first step here is to create a php file that contains a valid html document inside of it. 
            I called mine "index.php". It does not have to be a php file,  you could make an html file 
            instead if you are not going to run your php code here.</p>
        <pre>
            <code class="html">
    &lt;!DOCTYPE html>
    &lt;html>
        &lt;head>
            &lt;meta charset="UTF-8">
            &lt;title>Create account&lt;/title>
        &lt;/head>
        &lt;body>
        &lt;/body>
    &lt;/html>
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>Now inside the body tag, create your login form. There are three fields: one for the 
            password, one for username, and one for e-mail. The submit button is what the user
            will press to submit all 3 fields. The action property of the form tag specifies the php file
            which I will call when the user submits the form. We will make that file later in 
            the tutorial. </p>
        <pre>
            <code class="html">
        &lt;p>Join us!&lt;/p>
    &lt;form action="create_user.php" method = "POST" name="create_user_account" onsubmit="return validateForm()">
        Username: &lt;input type="text" name="username">
        Password: &lt;input type="password" name="password">
        Email: &lt;input type="text" name="email">
        &lt;button type="submit">Join now&lt;/button>
    &lt;/form>
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>The onsubmit function is how we validate the form in javaScript. In the head tag, you want 
            to add a script tag and add the following code:</p>
        <pre>
            <code class="javascript">
    function validateForm()
    {
        var form = document.forms["create_user_account"];
        if (form["username"].value == null || form["username"].value == "")
        {
            alert("Please choose a username");
            return false;
        }
        if (form["password"].value.length < 10)
        {
            alert("Your password must be at least 10 characters long");
            return false;
        }
        var atpos = form["email"].value.indexOf("@");
        var dotpos = form["email"].value.lastIndexOf(".");
        if (atpos < 1 || dotpos < atpos + 2 || dotpos + 2 >= form["email"].value.length)
        {
            alert("Not a valid e-mail address");
            return false;
        }
    }
</code>
        </pre>
        <p>Here we are making sure that there has been some kind of input entered into each field. 
            I am also enforcing a password length and performing a rudimentary email validation, 
            to make sure that an "@" sign is included in the email field. There are many other 
            functions you could add, such as validating password strength, checking to see if username
            is already taken, etc.</p>
        <p>This would also be a great time to make your css file "create_user_style.css". I can't 
            discuss the scope of how to create a CSS style sheet here, but for beginners I recommend 
            checking out the book "HTML & CSS: design and build websites" by Jon Duckett. You could 
            also check out this<a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/">website</a>for basic 
            lessons on CSS and HTML. </p>
        <h1>Adding user to the database.</h1>
        <p>Here is where we finally get to bring in our trusty friend, PHPass while also (safely) 
            connecting to the database. Create a php file (I called mine "create_user.php"). 
            Make sure the name matches what you put in your forms action attribute.</p>
        <p>For a stripped-down version of installing PHPass, go <a href="http://sunnyis.me/blog/secure-passwords/">here</a>.</p>
        Be sure to download PHPass <a href="http://www.openwall.com/phpass/">here</a>, if you haven't already.
        <pre><code class='php'>
&lt;?php

//you must include this file wherever you work with passwords
require("PasswordHash.php");
//the first argument, 8, is the algorithm used for password stretching
//the second argument allows the program to use portable hashes

//retrieving password
$password = $_POST["password"];
//retrieving username

    die("Password must be 72 characters or less");
}
//creating the hash variable which stores the hash
$hash = $hasher->HashPassword($password);
//if hash is created we connect to the database
if (strlen($hash) >= 20) {
    $con = mysqli_connect("myhost","myuser","mypassw","mydb");
    if (mysqli_connect_errno()) {
        echo "Failed to connect to MySQL: " . mysqli_connect_error();
    } else {
//if connection is made, we insert the values(password is now hash) into the database
        $result = mysqli_query($con, "INSERT INTO phpass (username, password, email) VALUES 
        ('{$username}', '{$hash}', '{$email}')");
        echo "&lt;p>User created.&lt;/p> &lt;a href='index.php'>Create another?&lt;/a>";
    }
} else {
    echo "Something went wrong";
}

        <h1> Verifying new user account in a database.</h1>
        <p>Now check the database to see if an id has been assigned, username has been entered,
        password has been hashed, and e-mail has been entered. You will know the password has been 
        hashed if it has been turned into a long string of characters.  See the example below:</p>
